# Hospital_Database_Management_System_SQL_Project

### A Hospital Database Management System project showcases a range of SQL queries developed for managing a Hospital Management System (HMS) database containing over 100,000 patient records along with related hospital data. These queries are designed to extract valuable insights related to hospital operations, patient care, and billing processes. The primary focus is on queries that support efficient hospital administration, streamline patient management, and facilitate accurate billing and reporting. Also, the key queries include:

* Monthly and yearly income analysis, including cash/credit payment breakdowns.
* Average patient admissions (weekly, monthly, yearly) per hospital.
* Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly hospital occupancy rates.
* Patient categorization by age (Child, Adult, Senior).
* Identification of the most consumed medicine, including by diagnosis.
* Calculation of average hospitalization days.

### These queries efficiently handle large datasets using techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), JOIN operations, and window functions for data aggregation and analysis.
